          <p>
            For a class project, I chose to redesign the
            <a href="https://www.bellevuefryingfish.com/menu"
              >menu of one of my favorite restaurants.</a
            >
            While the food looks delicious, it's difficult to find important
            information and the website is visually cluttered & confusing with
            lots of overlapping elements.
          </p>
          <p>
            To start, I identified several key usability & accessibility issues
            with the original website:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Slideshow of food on the top of the page may be unintuitive or
              confusing
            </li>
            <li>
              Overlapping text, sections, and images makes the website difficult
              to read and navigate
            </li>
            <li>
              The background clashes with the images of food in the menu,
              drawing attention away from the menu
            </li>
            <li>Lack of a menu bar on mobile</li>
            <li>Misaligned menu items and random empty space</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Evaluating the website with WAVE revealed a significant number of
            contrast errors and alerts, as well as a broken link. Notably, the
            WAVE report showed that much of the alt text on the page was
            uninformative (e.g. “listitem”, “list”,
            “anchor-label_dataItem-jywe6amv”), which makes the website
            inaccessible to users who use screen readers.

      <div id="about-container" style="flex-direction: column">
        <div id="about-image">
          <img
            style="width: 500px"
            id="about-me-image"
            src="img/speed_sketches.png"

        </div>
        <div id="about-text">
          <p>
            Once I identified the key problems with the original website, I made
            a series of speed sketches culminating in a final sketch. My goal
            was to simplify the structure of the menu, so I ditched the
            slideshow on the original website and used a simple grid for the
            menu.
          </p>

          <p>
            I then created and annotated a lo-fi mockup of the revised website
            with Figma!
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="about-image">

    <section id="styleguide">
      <h2>Style Guide & Hi-fi</h2>
      <div id="about-container" style="flex-direction: column">

          <img style="width: 500px" src="img/hifi_desktop_1.png" alt="" />
          <img style="width: 500px" src="img/hifi_desktop_2.png" alt="" />
          <img
            style="width: 500px; object-fit: cover"
            src="img/hifi_tablet.png"
            alt=""
          />
          <img style="width: 160px" src="img/hifi_phone.png" alt="" />

        </div>
        <div id="about-text">
          <p>
            In the hi-fi stage, I ended up changing a couple of things! Firstly,
            I decided that having an image as the background of the header was
            too cluttered since I wanted the focus to be on the menu items, so I
            removed it. I additionally made the reserve button more prominent.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the overall style guide, I used the logo of the restaurant as a
            reference and matched the style with modern, sleek-looking fonts and
            colors.

          <p>Nice! The website is looking much cleaner! :)</p>
          <p>
            Looking back, if I had more time, these are some things I would
            extend and improve upon:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Implementing sorting the menu by category! It's currently not
              interactive.
            </li>
            <li>
              Adding more personality to the website--while it's readable and
              easier to understand, it could use an aesthetics touch-up!
            </li>
            <li>
              Adding some of the extra features from the original website, such
              as a way of indicating if a dish is spicy and the "log in" option.
            </li>
          </ul>
